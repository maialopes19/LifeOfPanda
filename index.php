       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p>This peaceful creature with a distinctive black and white coat is adored
          by the world and considered a national treasure in China.</p>
       <p>The rarest member of the bear family, pandas live mainly in bamboo forests
          high in the mountains of western China, where they subsist almost entirely
          on bamboo. They must eat from 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, a formidable
          task  for which they use their enlarged wrist bones that function as
          opposable thumbs.</p>
       <p>A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the
           size of its mother—but can grow to up to 330 pounds as an adult.
           hese bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk. </p>
