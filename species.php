        <h2>Species of Pandas</h2>
        <p>There are only two different panda species in the world: </p>
        <ul id = "species_id">
           <li>Giant Pandas</li>
           <li>Red Pandas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Despite their common name, the two are not scientifically related to
              each other. They live in roughly the same geographic area and have a
              similar diet; both are also dwindling in terms of their population
              numbers.</p>
            <p>The giant panda is actually a species of bear, and as a result is known
              in some places as a “panda bear.” These animals can be quite large and
              are very distinctive in coloring: they are primarily white with
              large black patches around their eyes, on their ears, and
              across other portions of their bodies.</p>
        <p>As the red panda’s name suggests, these creatures tend to take on a more
              rust color, and are considerably smaller. In most cases they resemble
              domestic cats in both size and agility, and tend to live in rockier,
              more mountainous terrains. The two rarely if ever come into contact
              with each other in the wild.</p>
