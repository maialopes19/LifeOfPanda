        <h2>Ways of Life</h2>
        <p>Pandas are mistakenly believed to be poor
          breeders due to the disappointing reproductive performance of captive
          animals.But long-term studies have shown that wild panda populations
          can have reproductive rates comparable to some American black bear
          populations, which are thriving.</p>
          <p class = "facts">Breeding facts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Giant pandas reach sexual maturity at 5.5 to 6.5 years.</li>
            <li>A female can mate with several males, who compete over her.</li>
            <li>A male will seek out different females who are on heat.</li>
            <li>The mating season is in spring between March and May.</li>
            <li>Pandas normally give birth to single young</li>
          </ul>
          <p class = "facts">Birth Facts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A newborn panda cub weighs just 90-130 g.</li>
            <li>A panda's average life span in the wild is 14-20 years.</li>
            <li>Most pandas leave their mothers when she becomes pregnant again,
              usually at about 18 months.</li>
            <li>Pandas are dependent on their mothers for the first few months of
               their lives and are fully weaned at 8 to 9 months.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class = "facts">Adult facts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Giant pandas are generally solitary.</li>
            <li>Each adult has a well-defined home range.</li>
            <li>Although they are not territorial, females do not tolerate other
                females and sub-adults within the core areas of their range.</li>
            <li>While roaming their territories, they mark their routes by spraying
                urine, clawing tree trunks, and rubbing against objects.</li>
          </ul>
